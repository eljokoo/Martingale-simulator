# Martingale-simulator

A simple website that allows users to simulate betters using the Martingale Betting System on roulette spins and displays winnings/losses on a graph using JSCharting. [Here](https://www.techopedia.com/gambling-guides/martingale-betting-system) is an explanation of the Martingale Betting System and some of the issues with it.

## Capital

The starting amount of money for each better.

## Bet Value

The starting bet value which may increase over time due to the Martingale strategy.

## Attempts

The total number of roulette spins attempted by the better(s).

## Number of Betters

The number of betters participating in the simulation. This is helpful to see how chance affects wins/losses. Each better is a separate, independent simulation.

## Chart

The user can see each better's remaining money by hovering at a specific attempt number. It is also possible to zoom in on a specific attempt range by clicking and dragging over the area. The chart can be exported at any point.
